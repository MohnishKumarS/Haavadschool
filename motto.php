				<p><strong>Life Long Learning</strong></p>

				<div class="harvard-underline"></div>

				<ul>

					<li>As active investigators, the students need to initiate questions or hypothesis about a particular topic. The students will need to use a variety of methods to locate, collect, sort, and record information.</li>

					<li>As critical thinkers, students use a variety of strategies to analyze and synthesize information. From their research they will need to judge the data to see if it is useful for the question at hand.</li>

					<li>As self-directed learners students consider their learning styles, their prior knowledge, and their strengths and weaknesses. This will help children plan and organize their own thinking.</li>

					<li>As effective communicators students will need to demonstrate and express one’s feelings, thoughts, and ideas concerning a topic of investigation. Students need to work in collaborative situations to help facilitate good communication.</li>

					<li>As we consider the value of becoming a lifelong learner you see quickly that children need repeated practice with real world scenarios and guidance to foster the attributes of active investigator, critical thinker, self directed learner, and an effective communicator. These attributes will help strengthen the desire and the ability of becoming lifelong learners.</li><br>

				<p><strong>Values</strong></p>

				<div class="harvard-underline"></div>

				<ul>

					<li>Teaching students to be respectful of others can now be applied to their behavior online as well as off-line. Students should understand the importance of acting responsibly and respectfully when using forums, social media, or mobile devices.</li>

					<li>Similarly, good citizenship can now be equally applied to practicing good digital citizenship, whereby students learn to avoid the misuse of information or to acknowledge and respect others’ right to peace and privacy.</li>

					<li>Showing tolerance and understanding to those less fortunate. The escalating refugee crisis is challenging both communities and schools to integrate people in a respectful and sustainable way. School is the ideal place to start teaching the correct values towards refugees and develop understanding of different cultures around the world.</li>
