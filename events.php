				<p><strong>CLEANLINESS DRIVE:</strong></p>
				<p>Cleanliness is a habit, not an act. However starting a campaign or drive highlights the issue, builds champions and brings focus on the task at hand. This also further leads to internalizing and inculcating cleanliness as a matter of habit and routine.<br/><br/>Our school organized Cleanliness Drive under Life Skills and Personality Development programme. The main purpose of this programme was to create awareness among the students regarding cleanliness and its benefits. Under this programme, all the students of Haavad International School   participated in the drive. Even teachers were the essential part of this drive. As a part of this Cleanliness Drive, we had to clean the whole school. The aunties of the school had to be the observers.  The drive came to end with the Principal’s speech insisting the importance of sanitation.</p><br/>
