				<p><strong>I extend a warm welcome to you and your family !</strong></p>

				<p>It is rightly said that “A dream becomes a goal when action is taken towards its achievement” and we are committed in taking constructive and purposeful actions to produce optimistic, independent, compassionate, life-long learners and leaders who will bring glory to the school, state and the Nation.</p>

				<p> As the new Principal of Haavad International School, I am delighted that the school’s values align with my own personal values, including the importance of trust, respect, innovation and a sense of community.</p>

				<p>Haavad International School is a dynamic learning community that has at its core positive and constructive relationships where the expectation is high, learning is relevant, deep which facilitates progress for every student.  There is a strong emphasis on striving for personal best and on the holistic development of the student.</p>

				<p>Haavad International School provides high quality education through a relevant and stimulating curriculum in a secure and purposeful environment. We integrate digital pedagogies throughout the curriculum. Classroom spaces are carefully organized to support learning. Our well-resourced facilities and beautiful grounds create a sense of place.</p>

				<p>Our school promotes a set of values which empowers students to make positive contributions to the school and the wider communities.  Our students live and learn by our values: Respect, Pride, Responsibility and Perseverance.</p>

				<p>Today, children in India are growing in a more challenging and demanding environment. The rate of change in every sphere is rapid with the enhanced knowledge exchange and technology development, the world is going flatter.</p>

				<p>In all our endeavours, the focus is to strengthen competencies needed to be autonomous, lifelong learners. We make concerted efforts for a holistic development of the students who enter the school portals. A wide range of multi-dimensional activities are organized which go a long way in propelling a self-belief, confidence in decision making and problem solving along with chiseling of soft skills.</p>

				<p>The practice of value oriented process acts as a nucleus around which all our school activities revolve. We are very conscious of the fact that emotional stability plays a very significant role in the healthy growth of a child. One of the important tools to achieve this is through more interaction and one to one rapport with our children. This open and interactive approach also helps in discovering and strengthening inherent talent in the students. All our school activities are based on a participatory spirit that reduces the inhibition levels of the students and thus assists the students in becoming aware of their potential. The school atmosphere evokes a team spirit amongst the students and teachers with a conviction that ‘We can do it’. </p>

				<p>High standards and expectations for each student in regard to academic performance, co-curricular participation, and responsible citizenship are the foundation of our school. It is with pride that we hold these high standards and ask each of our students to commit to maintaining the extraordinary record of achievement and contribution .Full participation in academic and co-curricular programs and a willingness to act responsibly as an individual within our educational environment are the factors that enable all to have a successful and enjoyable year.</p>

				<p>The first thing I’d like you to know about Haavad International School is that we encourage and motivate our students to dream big. Our Mission is to nurture individual potential. We believe in cultivating intelligence and talent. Rather than being fixed and finite, intelligence and talent will expand and grow, given the right encouragement. So we aim to keep students’ dreams and aspirations alive.</p>

				<p>We are doing all we can to ensure that when students eventually leave school, they will do so as confident, caring young people, who are creative, collaborative, and committed to their learning. Our values of respect, integrity, curiosity, and excellence, are behind everything we do as a staff and as a school.</p>

				<p><b>We believe that effective educators:</b></p>

				<li>Create opportunities for intellectual risk-taking, collaboration, problem-solving, and application of classroom learning to real life situations.</li>

				<p><b>We believe that successful students:</b></p>

				<li>Demonstrate a sensitivity to the precision and nuances of written, visual, and aural medium through comprehension, interpretation, and evaluation.</li>

				<p>In conclusion, I wish you all a wonderful school year. If I can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me and know that my door is always open. I can be reached at harvardcbse@gmail.com also. I am honored to serve as your principal.</p>

				<p>Sincerely,<br>Mrs. S.SELVARANI M.Com.,B.Ed.</p>
