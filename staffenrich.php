	                   <p><strong> MOTIVATIONAL WORKSHOP</strong></p></br>
                        <p> On 14/07/2019 a motivational workshop, ‘Creative Aspects of’ Education’ was conducted
						for the teachers of our school by Mr. V.S. Ravichandran, well known and popular Educational Psychologist and trainer.</br>
                          The workshop began by describing the evoluation of the role of a teacher, from being lecturer to facilitator, coach and mentor. In fact now, the teacher is responsible for the holistic development of students. Earlier, the content was teacher-centric but now it is student – driven.
						  The content and context are now set in accordance with students needs. </br>
                           Mr. Ravichandran recommended the creating of dynamic learning environment 
						   by applying interesting content to hold the attention of students whilst simultaneously addressing their problems.</br>						  
                        </p></br>
