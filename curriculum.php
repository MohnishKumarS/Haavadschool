		<h2>"CURRICULUM"</h2>
		<p>The school follows the curriculum as laid down by central board ofsecondary Education,New delhi . It prepares children to CBSE class 10 and 12 Examinations.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="about-mv">
		<div class="container">
			<p>It has classes starting from Lower kindergarten.</p>
			<p>The Haavad offers a number of extra and co-curricular transactions in Haavad.</p>
			<p>Digital Learning experience plays an important  and extensive role in the learning  experience of children of children of Haavad.</p>
			<p>Your child's teacher will have definite ideas about your child's personal development. She'll encourage him to have a go, not to give up when things go wrong, and to come up with his own ideas about the world.</p>
            <p>Variety of activity will help your child to work out what he likes and build his sense of himself. His teacher may encourage him to explain his preferences to his classmates. Talking to the whole class will boost his confidence and help him learn to express himself.</p>
            <p>Your child's teacher will challenge your child with tasks that stretch him. Succeeding at something that is difficult is another great way to build confidence.</p>
            <p>School is not always fun. Your child's initial feelings of excitement may fade and he may sometimes get confused and cross. He may take out his frustrations on you, refusing to get out of bed or clinging desperately on to your legs at the school gate.</p>
            <p>Hopefully, your child will easily find some friends at his new school. Building positive relationships with others is a key part of his social development. Your child's teacher will be watching to check that he's making friends and will have strategies to help if he's struggling. Social development isn't just about your child's own little world. He'll find his horizons are broadened in his reception year, and that it's fun learning about what happens around the globe.</p>
			<p>Your child's teacher will introduce him to other traditions and cultures, probably by talking about their festivals and celebrations. So don't be surprised if he's celebrating Diwali or Eid in the autumn, and then rehearsing for a nativity play in December.</p>
			<p>The most important thing we can teach our children is how to learn on their own. What students should learn in school is at the forefront of the education reform debates taking place across the India and elsewhere.</p>
			<p>Ed-tech stakeholders for years have been touting the need for students to learn so-called “21st century skills” such as problem solving, critical thinking, and media literacy to prepare for the new global, digital economy, while others are calling for students to have strong math and science skills.</p>

				<p><strong>1. Read </p></strong>
				<p>“If you can read, you can learn to do anything.” — Candace Kavey<br>Reading is the first step to good writing. In order to learn social studies, science, and math, you need to know how to read. Reading is the gateway to all knowledge.</p><br>
				<p><strong>2. Type</p></strong>
				<p>"This may sound notoriously ‘old school,’ but the one skill I often see missing is that of being able to touch-type. The speed at which one interacts with the computer is sometimes overlooked".</p><br>
				<p><strong>3. Write</p></strong>
				<p>“The essential skill that all students need is the ability to write fluently and persuasively. I would love to see every student develop writing as a skill."</p><br>
				<p><strong>4. Communicate effectively, and with respect</p></strong>
				<p>“The single most important skill for every student to learn is how to communicate effectively. This, of course, begins with understanding and using simple words, gestures, and expressions and expands into written and technology-based communication using increasingly complex thought processes. Effective communication is the key to all learning and to compatible interaction with others.”</p><br>
				<p><strong>5. Question</p></strong>
				<p>A student’s ability to formulate questions encompasses and assumes a wide range of other skills: connecting with information, challenging preconceptions, evaluating validity, imagining other options, and taking ownership of his or her own learning.”<br>“The skill I think students should learn is asking good questions. This is a component of critical thinking that allows students to begin formulating their own ideas</p><br>
				<p><strong>6. Be resourceful</p></strong>
				<p>“To be independently resourceful. Students should learn how to find and use resources around them to assist in their learning.<br>“Resourcefulness: the knowledge of where to find the answers, ideas, information, etc.”<br>“The one skill I want my students to walk away with is the ability to think critically to be able to find answers to whatever they need or want to know.”</p><br>
				<p><strong>7. Be accountable</p></strong>
				<p>Lifelong learners need to know their own capacity and what is out there to find and learn.<br>“Respect and responsibility"</p><br>
				<p><strong>8. Know how to learn</p></strong>
				<p> “The most important skill for everyone to learn is how to learn!<br>“The most important thing we can teach our children is how to learn on their own. Like the old adage, ‘If you feed someone they eat one meal, if you teach them to fish they can eat for life.’</p><br>
				<p><strong>9. Think critically</p></strong>
				<p>Learning things by trial and error, or how to learn from one’s own mistakes. “Critical decision-making skills. Without good decision-making skills, students can’t analyze information or what steps to take to achieve personal and academic goals. They need to understand that every decision has consequences–good or bad.<br>“It would be the ability to analyze a problem, to be able to deal with an unfamiliar situation, and to be able to reason his/her way to a credible (not necessarily right) solution.” <br>“Students need critical thinking skills; they need to be able to apply knowledge and be problem solvers.</p><br>
				<p><strong> 10. Be happy</p></strong>
				<p>“The skill I think students need most is how to be a happy, caring person. Although it isn’t directly taught in school, if the focus was on character education at home and at school, we would see a decrease of all sorts of negative things in our world and an increase in the positive.</p>
